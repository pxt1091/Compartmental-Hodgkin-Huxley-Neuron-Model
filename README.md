# Compartmental-Hodgkin-Huxley-Neuron-Model
Parallel Implementation with MPI

The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is commonly used to define and implement parallel computations on message‐passing computer architectures.

This project explores the effects of model parameters on a simple compartmental Hodgkin‐Huxley neuron model. Specifically, the effect of parallel implementation and load balancing on computation time and parallel vs. sequential speedup is measured.
